# Learning Journey
Hi, I'm Velma!  
This is my digital notebook where I document everything I'm learning as I become a software developer.

### What’s Inside

- `html-css/` → All my practice with HTML & CSS
- `javascript/` → JavaScript challenges and exercises
- `python/` → Python learning + small scripts
- `projects/` → Projects I'm building as I learn
- `notes/` → Study notes and resources

I’m sharing my journey publicly to stay accountable and grow in public.
